“Love your family, work super hard, live your passion.”

Hello, nice to meet you. My name is Christian D. Walker. My nickname is Dubs. I am from Farrell,Pennsylvania. I currently attend Allegheny college with a double major in business economics and computer science.

I am an entrepreneur. I have always been invested in service work and giving back to the community. My life goal is to become a philanthropist and venture capitalist. I will give back to my family and hometown.
