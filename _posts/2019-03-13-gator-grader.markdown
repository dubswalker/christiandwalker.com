[Gator Grader] is a tool that checks the work of programmers and writers. This tool is crucial to assisting with technical writing standards. This is a tool that was created by students and Professor Kapfhammer of Allegheny College. 

I had the priviledge to assist this project during my 481 Software Innovation 2 class. My contribution included working on an issue tracker, assist with a summary and creating [logo] variations for the entire project itself. Working on the issue tracker put a lot into perspective for me as a computer scientist and I realized my weaknesses and strengths that I could provide to the team. I wasn't the best at hard-coding, but tried my best to provide feedback and positive input. Upon understanding this I was assigned another issue that I could work on independently to contribute to the class and overall project.


This [logo] was created using the Adobe Suite's Fireworks, Photoshop and exported with Illustrator. After briefly meeting with Professor Kapfhammer the decision was to create a logo in a "flat icon" style. The drawn sketch of the logo included an alligator with a graduation cap. This is to indicate that this logo can be used for college undergrads, grads and professionals.
